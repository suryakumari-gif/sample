JDBC
=====
As if now it is known as trademark.

But earlier it is known as Java Database Connectivity.

RAM is a temperory storage device or medium.

During the program execution our data will store inside RAM.

Once the program execution is completed we will loss the data.

To overcome this limitation we are making our applications writing the data in a file or database software.

File and database software acts like a permanent storage device or medium.

Persistence
==========
The process of storing and managing the data for a long period of time is called persistence.


Important terminologies
=======================
1) Persistence store 
--------------------
It is a place where we will store and manage the data for a long period of time.
ex:
	Files
	Database 

2) Peristence data 
----------------
Data of a persistence store is called persistence data.
ex:
	Records 
	Tables 

3) Persistence operations 
--------------------
Insert,update,delete,create,select and etc are called persitence operations. In the realtime 
these operation is also known as CURD operation, CRUD operation or SCUD operation.

ex:
	C - create 		S - select 
	U - update		C - create 
	R - read		U - update 
	D - delete 		D - delete 

4) Persistence logic
--------------------
A logic which is capable to perform persistence operations is called persistence logic.
ex:
	IOStream 
	JDBC Code 	
	Hibernate Code 

5) Persistence technology 
--------------------------
A technology which is used to develop peristence logics is called persistence technology.
ex:
	JDBC
	Hibernate 


Q) What is JDBC?

JDBC is a persistence technology which is used to develop persistence logics having the capability to perform persistence operations on persistence data of a persistence store.

Note:
-----
					IOStream 
	JavaApp ------------------------------------------------------ File 
			     Serialization/Deserialization


					JDBC Code 
	JavaApp ------------------------------------------------------ Database Software 


Limitations with file as a persistence store 
=============================================
> We can store limited amount of data.

> There is no security.

> Fetching the data with multiple conditions is not possible.

> It does not show an application with relationships.

> It does not allow us to apply constraints (Not Null,Unique,primary key,foregin key & check).

> Updation and deletion of data can't be done directly.

> Merging and comparision of data can't be done easily.


Advantages with database software as a persistence store
=========================================================
> We can store unlimited amount of data.

> There is a security.

> It supports common query language.

> Fetching the data with multiple condition is possible.

> It shows an application with relationships.

> It allows us to apply contraints.

> Updation and deletion of data can be done directly.

> Merging and comparision of data can be done easily.


Every JDBC application consider as a two-tier application because java with JDBC code acts like a frontend/tier1/layer and database software acts like a backend/tier2/layer2.

The one which is visible to the enduser to perform some operations is called frontend.

The one which is not visible to the enduser but it performs operations based on the instructions given by frontend is called backend.

Enduser is a non-technical person. He can't prepare and execute SQL query.So he depends upon frontend developers having the capability to do that work for them.

JDBC Driver 
============
JDBC driver acts like a bridge between java application and database software.

It is used to convert java instructions to database instructions and vice versa.

Diagram: jdbc1.2


ODBC Driver 
============
D2K, VBScript, Perl and etc uses ODBC Driver to locate and interact with database software.

Diagram: jdbc1.3


ODBC driver developed in c language by taking the support of pointers. But java does not support pointers. To overcome this limitation Sun Micro System introduced JDBC drivers exclusively.


Q) What is JDBC ? 

JDBC is a open technology given by Sun Micro system having set of rules and guidelines to develop JDBC drivers to interact with multiple database softwares.


Q) What is ODBC?

ODBC is a open technology given by Xopen company having set of rules and guidelines to develop ODBC drivers to interact with multiple database softwares.


Q) How many drivers are there in JDBC?

We have four drivers in JDBC.

1) Type1 JDBC Driver / JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver 

2) Type2 JDBC Driver / Native API Driver 

3) Type3 JDBC Driver / Net Protocol Driver 

4) Type4 JDBC Driver / Native Protocol Driver
